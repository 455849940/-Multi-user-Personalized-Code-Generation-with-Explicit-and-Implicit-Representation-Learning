If setName is not successful, throw an exception, print the exception information, and then continue to process the next line.\n3. If addScore is not successful, throw an exception, print the exception information, and then continue to process the next line. If both 2 and 3 are successful, print the student information (`toString`).\n4. If any other exception occurs while parsing the student data line, print the exception information, and then continue to process the next line.\n5.
